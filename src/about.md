# About Me

I'm a software engineer based in Germany with an MSc in Computer Science and over ten years of experience working with Linux systems and C/C++. My main interests are in software engineering and architecture, with a focus on clean, maintainable code, C++ and Python development.

This site is where I share technical insights, development practices, and architectural ideas from my projects and other sources. Itâ€™s also a space to explore topics that I care about in more depth, such as computer science, mathematics, and physics.

Thanks for stopping by. Whether you're here to exchange ideas or simply browsing, I hope you find something useful. Feel free to reach out with suggestions or to start a conversation.
