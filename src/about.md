# About Me

I hold a M. Sc. in computer science and have been working with linux-based systems and C/C++ for over a decade. My professional interests lie primarily in software engineering and software architecture, with a strong emphasis on C++ and python development.

This site serves as a space to document technical insights, development practices, and architectural considerations encountered throughout my work. It reflects both my commitment to clean, maintainable code and my ongoing exploration of my favorite topics - computer science, math and physics.

Whether you're here to exchange ideas or simply browsing for inspiration, I appreciate your visit.
