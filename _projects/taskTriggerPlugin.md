Task trigger is a VSCode extension that groups all available tasks in a workspace and displays them in the explorer view. Tasks are grouped by sources and subfolders within the sources, based on a configurable separator regular expression. For example, the task name `FolderA: TaskA` creates a `FolderA` containing a `TaskA` (with separator regex set to `":"`).

Clicking on any displayed task triggers the execution of the configured command in VSCodeâ€™s tasks.json file.

The extension can be installed via the VSCode extension marketplace with the ID *MichaelBraun1994.task-trigger*.
