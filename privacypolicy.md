# Privacy Policy

Personal data (usually referred to just as „data“ below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.

Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the „GDPR“), „processing“ refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.

The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.

Our privacy policy is structured as follows:

I. Information about us as controllers of your data
II. The rights of users and data subjects
III. Information about the data processing

## I. Information about us as controllers of your data

The party responsible for this website (the „controller“) for purposes of data protection law is:

Michael, Braun
c/o Online-Impressum.de #35202
Europaring 90
53757 Sankt Augustin

E-Mail: contact@michaelbraun.dev 

## II. The rights of users and data subjects

With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right

    to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
    to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
    to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
    to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
    to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).

In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.

Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.

## III. Information about the data processing

Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.

## Cookies

### a) Session cookies

We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address.

This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.

The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.

If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.

When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.

### b) Third-party cookies

If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.

Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.

### c) Disabling cookies

You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.

If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.

## Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics on our website, a web analysis service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, a subsidiary of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as “Google”.

Google Analytics helps us analyse website usage and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The user can revoke consent to the use of Google Analytics in accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR at any time for the future via the “Cookie Settings” on our website.

Information such as time, location and frequency of website visits as well as interactions with the website (e.g. click paths, ads seen/clicked, clicks on links) including the user’s IP address are transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there for a maximum of 2 months.

Google LLC is part of the “Data Privacy Framework”, for which the EU Commission has issued an adequacy decision in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR:

<https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list>

Google also records “demographic characteristics” and can create statistics that allow statements to be made about the age, gender and interests of site visitors. This is done through the automated analysis of advertising and information from third parties.

If the user has activated personalised ads in their Google account and agrees to Google Analytics, Google can analyse usage behaviour across devices – that is, across all devices that the user has linked to their Google account. Google creates models for cross-device conversions; only anonymous statistics are sent to us, no personal data.

If the user wishes to deactivate this cross-device analysis, he or she can deactivate the “Personalised Advertising” function in the settings of his or her Google account using the following link:

<https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=de>

We use Google Analytics with an anonymisation function. As a result, Google will shorten the user’s IP address within the EU member states or in other contracting states to the EEA Agreement.

Google uses the data collected to evaluate the user’s visit to the website and to compile reports on website activities for us. The data are also used to provide other services related to website and internet usage. Google may transfer this information to third parties where required by law, or where such third parties process the data on Google’s behalf.

According to Google, under no circumstances will the user’s IP address be linked to other Google data. Google offers further information and options for preventing data usage here:

<https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners>

If the user does not agree to the collection, he or she can also prevent it by installing the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics.
